<h1 style="text-align: center;"> The Power of Online Communities and the Art of Large Scale Decision Process </h1>

How wonderful are the online communities! In the vast landscape of the digital era, the emergence of online communities stands as a demonstration of the transformative power of the internet. This virtual world offers a unique and powerful mean for people from every part of the globe to connect and exchange ideas, fostering the development of new tools and platforms from collaborative efforts, of which Wikipedia is a prime example. However, the growth of these communities brings along a new set of challenges related to the organization and management at such a large scale: How can thousands to millions of users make a decision together and agree on common rules and goals?

To address this question, we study the case of Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, which has been built and maintained by millions of volunteers over the past two decades. In particular, we focus on the English Wikipedia, which is the largest Wikipedia edition with 7 million articles and 46 million registered users and for which we have access to a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2003 to 2013, focusing on Wikipedia elections, namely the : “Requests for Adminship” (RfA), as well as a dataset of the number of monthly edits per user over the same period.
The relevance of choosing Wikipedia as a case study is twofold. First, Wikipedia is a unique example of a large-scale online community that has been able to sustain itself over the years and despite its impressive growth. Second, Wikipedia has a well-defined and transparent process for electing administrators with publicly available data, which makes it an ideal case study for understanding the dynamics of collective decision-making in online communities.

## *Time Series and source EMMA* 

One first step towards understanding the process of collective decision-making is to study the dynamics of voting behavior over time. In particular, we are interested in the temporal patterns of votes and how they relate to the final outcome of the election.
To extract the timing of votes, we used the timestamps given in the raw data and defined the first vote casted for a target as the starting point of an election round. From there, we wondered if we could extract groups of voters that would vote earlier or later in the election which would be indicative of influential and influenced voters respectively.

PLOT DISTRIB VOTING TIME WITH YEAR TO ADD

By seeing the distribution of voting times, we were surprised to discover a bimodal distribution (when using a log scale) and in conjunction with our idea of splitting voters into two groups, we were tempted to explain this phenomenon as indicating the actual existence of two groups of voters separated by their voting time. However, after some investigation of the data and looking into the literature about the RfA rules, we quickly realized that this bimodal distribution can actually be easily explained by the fact that some targets that were not elected would be re-nominated and thus would have a second round of votes (or even more). And after delving deeper into the data and with the information we found on the RfA process, we were able to define properties of the voting time enabling us to distinguish multiple rounds of votes for a given target. We could also check that the resulting rounds were consistent with the data by extracting some comments coherent with our assumptions.
