How wonderful are the online communities! In the vast landscape of the digital era, the emergence of online communities stands as a demonstration of the transformative power of the internet. This virtual world offers a unique and powerful mean for people from every part of the globe to connect and exchange ideas, fostering the development of new tools and platforms from collaborative efforts, of which Wikipedia is a prime example. However, the growth of these communities brings along a new set of challenges related to the organization and management at such a large scale: How can thousands to millions of users make a decision together and agree on common rules and goals?

To address this question, we study the case of Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, which has been built and maintained by millions of volunteers over the past two decades. In particular, we focus on the English Wikipedia, which is the largest Wikipedia edition with 7 million articles and 46 million registered users and for which we have access to a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2003 to 2013, focusing on Wikipedia elections, namely the : “Requests for Adminship” (RfA), as well as a dataset of the number of monthly edits per user over the same period.
The relevance of choosing Wikipedia as a case study is twofold. First, Wikipedia is a unique example of a large-scale online community that has been able to sustain itself over the years and despite its impressive growth. Second, Wikipedia has a well-defined and transparent process for electing administrators with publicly available data, which makes it an ideal case study for understanding the dynamics of collective decision-making in online communities.
